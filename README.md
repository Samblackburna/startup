# Quilted News

[My Notes](notes.md)

Simple news aggregation application. 

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Traditional print news apps largely employ similar web designs, essentially appearing as a list of article links. A news aggregation site that simply queues and shows the reader articles would provide opportunities for increased content targeting. I plan to create the first bit of the app, including a mechanism to view and swipe through articles from a database of webscraped local news articles.

### Design

And next is a diagram explaning the backend page design

### Key features

- Displays article titles, authors, publishing dates, and article content from a database of local news sources
- Allows users to swipe from article to article (laying the foundation for the future implementation of a predictive algorithm serving readers the stories they are most interested in)
- Uses an RSS feed from at least one news source to scrape and pull newly published articles into the app's database

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Two HTML page formats. One for login and another - utilizing varying content - to display actual articles.
- **CSS** - Application styling ensuring readablility and a consistent brand feel across screen sizes and applications.
- **React** - Simple swiping application with views componetized and reactive to user's actions.
- **Service** - Background service with endpoints for:
    - Randomizing which article is displayed to user
    - Retrieving time user spends on an article
- **DB/Login** - Store users. Track time users spend on articles, - prepping for an eventual recommendation algorithm that I won't plan on implementing in this class. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database.
- **WebSocket** - When a new article is added to database, user is notified and article is bumped to from of queue
